# Personal Portfolio Website

## Backend
Node / Express JS and SQLite / HTMX.
Only basic data fetching for displaying the repos so a simple express server with a sprinkle of htmx along with ejs for templating.

## Frontend
HTML, CSS (Tailwind), Vanilla JS.
Tried my hand at tailwind after seeing all the hype. I definitely prefer using a traditional css approach with SaSS for nesting instead of the inline utility approach of tailwind.

## Design
UX/UI design is not one of my passions so I keep it simple and minimal.
